\\About the Program

Welcome! Heard about microsoft encoder 4 so i thought why the hell not, started tweaking with it and built a highly advanced and lightning
fast Screen Recorder! Has a lot of functions other recorders don't. although this program is pretty much completed and everything runs and
works %100, i would like to make it open sourced to show others how i completed it, let me know what you think! all feedback is 
appreciated. 


\\Program Information

.NET framework
Microsoft Encoder
bunifu and stock tool kit

Highly detailed source with written lines explaining what i wrote/did.
Took me 2 days start to finish.
