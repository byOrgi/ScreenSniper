*****IF YOU USE PARTS OF THIS PROGRAM OR YOU USE MY INTERFACE IDEAS, PLEASE GIVE ME CREDIT! Making it open source to help people!!!!*****



\\About the Program

Welcome! Heard about microsoft encoder so i thought why the hell not, started tweaking with it and built a highly advanced and lightning
fast Screen Recorder! Has a lot of functions other recorders don't. although this program is pretty much completed and everything runs and
works %100, i would like to make it open sourced to show others how i completed it, and if i get back to it i would like to make it even
more advanced! I thought i did pretty good seeing as how this is my first published program. let me know what you think! all feedback is 
appreciated. 


\\Program Information

.NET framework
Microsoft Encoder
bunifu and stock tool kit

Highly detailed source with written lines explaining what i wrote/did.
Took me 2 days start to finish.
